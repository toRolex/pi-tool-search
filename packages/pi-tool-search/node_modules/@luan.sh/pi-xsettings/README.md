`@luan.sh/pi-xsettings` is a settings host for Pi extensions. It adds the
`/xsettings` editor to Pi's interactive TUI, persists Pi and extension settings
in one `xsettings.toml` file, exposes a UI-free SDK
(`@luan.sh/pi-xsettings/sdk`) that other extensions use to declare typed
settings, and binds keys from `keybindings.json` to actions that extensions
register through pi-libactions.

## Preview

[Watch the demo](https://pi.luan.sh/media/previews/pi-xsettings-6661ed0cbe89.mp4).

## Install

```sh
pi install npm:@luan.sh/pi-xsettings
```

Optional companion: `pi install npm:@luan.sh/pi-panels`. When a side-panel
host is present, `/xsettings` opens as a "Settings" tab beside the session;
without it, the editor opens as a fullscreen overlay.

## Use

In the TUI, run `/xsettings`. Outside the TUI (print, RPC, and other
non-interactive modes) the command only prints a warning.

The left sidebar lists eight pages: UI, Editor, UX, Animations, Terminal,
Behavior, Interaction, and Tools, with each page's sections underneath.
Extension settings appear under the label the extension registered. The search
field at the top filters settings across every page. `/` focuses search; Tab
(or the key bound to `xsettings.cursor.toggle`) toggles focus between sidebar
and content. In the sidebar, arrows or `j`/`k` move and Enter opens the
highlighted destination. In the content, `h`/`l` or left/right change pages,
Enter edits the selected setting, and Backspace restores its default.

Every confirmed edit is written to `xsettings.toml` immediately. Settings
marked live (the theme and all `@luan.sh/pi-libtui` settings) apply to the running TUI
at once. Other settings need a reload: when the editor was opened from
`/xsettings`, Pi reloads after you close it; otherwise it tells you to run
`/reload`.

## `xsettings.toml`

The file lives in Pi's agent directory, normally `~/.pi/agent/xsettings.toml`.
If it does not exist, the host creates it with a single comment line.

Values are stored under four fixed category tables: `appearance`, `behavior`,
`interaction`, and `tools`. Inside a category, Pi's own settings are keyed
`pi.<key>` and extension settings `<namespace>.<key>`:

```toml
[appearance]
pi.theme = "tokyo-night"
pi-libtui.iconPack = "nerd-fonts"
pi-xsettings.presentation = "fullscreen"

[interaction]
pi.steeringMode = "one-at-a-time"

[tools]
pi.defaultTools = []
```

Unknown keys and other top-level tables are kept but not shown in the editor.
Writes go to a temporary file followed by a rename; a symlinked path has its
target written rather than the link. Comments and layout are not preserved. An
omitted `pi.defaultTools` means "use Pi's default tools"; `pi.defaultTools =
[]` disables every built-in tool.

Recognized Pi settings (theme, compaction, retry, transport, message delivery,
enabled models, default tools, and the other `pi.*` keys shown in the editor)
are mirrored into `settings.json` in the same directory, because Pi reads that
file before extensions load. Keep bootstrap values such as packages, trust,
telemetry, provider, and model configuration in `settings.json` directly.

## Settings owned by this package

Both namespaces below are registered with `createSettings` and edited via
`/xsettings`; when a value is absent or invalid the default applies.
Namespace `@luan.sh/pi-xsettings` (label "Xsettings") has one key, `presentation`,
default `side-panel` (or `fullscreen`); side-panel falls back to fullscreen
when no panel host is present.

Namespace `@luan.sh/pi-libtui` (label "TUI", all applied live):

| Key | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `iconPack` | `unicode` (`nerd-fonts`, `unicode`, `emoji`) |
| `activityIndicator` / `activityMessage` | `spinner` / `phase` |
| `textEffect` / `textEffectScope` / `pulseEffect` | `off` / `message` / `off` |
| `statusPresentation` | `standard` |
| `animationSpeed` | `normal` (`slow`, `relaxed`, `normal`, `fast`, `very-fast`) |
| `animationSmoothness` | `balanced` (`economy`, `balanced`, `smooth`, `ultra`) |
| `thinking*`, `working*`, `tool*` (`Indicator`, `Message`, `TextEffect`, `PulseEffect`, `Presentation`) | `inherit` (use the General value) |
| `powerline` / `powerlineButtons` / `softCursor` | `false` |
| `insertionCursor` / `navigationCursor` / `selectionCursor` | `virtual` |

## Actions and keybindings

Actions registered by this package: `xsettings.toggle` (open the editor, same
as `/xsettings`), `xsettings.cursor.toggle` (toggle sidebar/content focus
inside the editor, replacing Tab), and `xsettings.effort.decrease` /
`xsettings.effort.increase` (step through the current model's supported
thinking levels, stopping at either end).

None of them has a default key. Bind them in `keybindings.json` in Pi's agent
directory, normally `~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json`. Each property is an action
ID; each value is a key ID string or an array of key ID strings:

```json
{
  "xsettings.toggle": "ctrl+,",
  "xsettings.cursor.toggle": "ctrl+t",
  "xsettings.effort.decrease": ["alt+,"],
  "xsettings.effort.increase": ["alt+."]
}
```

The file is read once when extensions load, so reload Pi after editing it.
Invalid JSON, an invalid key ID, or an unbound action installs no shortcut;
the action stays available through its command or UI. This package is also the
global shortcut host: for every action any installed extension registers
through @luan.sh/pi-libactions, it calls Pi's `registerShortcut()` with the keys
configured for that action ID. Other extensions' READMEs list their action IDs.

## SDK for extension authors

Import the UI-free SDK, not the extension entry point:

```ts
import { createSettings } from "@luan.sh/pi-xsettings/sdk";

const settings = createSettings({
  namespace: "pi-example",
  label: "Example",
  definitions: {
    enabled: {
      label: "Enabled",
      description: "Enable the example feature.",
      category: "behavior",
      type: "boolean",
      default: true,
    },
    mode: {
      label: "Mode",
      description: "How the feature runs.",
      category: "behavior",
      type: "enum",
      default: "safe",
      options: [{ value: "safe", label: "Safe", description: "" }, { value: "fast", label: "Fast", description: "" }],
    },
  },
});

const unregister = settings.register((values) => { /* values.enabled, values.mode */ });
```

`createSettings()` returns `defaults` (compiled defaults), `get()` (a clone of
the current values), and `register(onValues)` (returns a disposer). Types are
`boolean`, `string`, `enum`, `multi-enum` (with `ordered`), `string-list`
(helper `stringListSetting()`, with `minItems`), and schema-checked `list`
(helper `listSetting(schema, definition)` with a TypeBox schema and a
declarative item definition). Enum options may carry a @luan.sh/pi-libtui `color`, or
point at another setting's list via `{ source: "setting", setting, field }`.

Each definition names a `category` (its TOML table). Optional `page` places it
on one of the eight pages without changing the TOML path (default: the page
matching the category, `appearance` on UI); `section` sets the heading
(default: the registration `label`); `apply` is `"live"` or `"reload"`
(default `"reload"`, overridable per registration); `preview` selects an
animation preview kind. Invalid stored values fall back to the default, enum
values resolve to a valid option, and multi-enum values drop stale choices.

Registration works before the host loads or when it is absent: values arrive
when the host publishes them, and without a host the extension keeps its
defaults. Add `@luan.sh/pi-xsettings` to your package's `dependencies`; do not
create a separate settings file or settings screen.
