//#region src/utils/guardWebKitScrollDuringRebuild.d.ts
/**
 * Runs a wholesale code-column rebuild with the pre element's height pinned,
 * working around a WebKit bug (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=308027):
 * when the subtree of a `container-type: inline-size` element is rewritten in
 * bulk (column innerHTML swaps, grid-row span rewrites), WebKit resolves the
 * ancestor scroller's offset against a transiently collapsed interim layout
 * and clamps scrollTop to 0 — the scroller visibly jumps to the top on every
 * edit. Pinning `min-height` keeps that interim layout at full height so the
 * scroll offset survives; the layout read before unpinning is required, since
 * it materializes the interim layout while the pin is active.
 *
 * Both the pin height read and the pinned-layout read force a synchronous
 * layout, so callers own the gating via shouldGuardRebuildScroll: Safari-only,
 * edit-mode-only, and never inside CodeView's batched read/write render pass.
